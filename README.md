# Auction-Mechanism-Designer
Objective-Build an auction market simulation for Treasury and IPO auctions implementing English,
Dutch, and Sealed-Bid auction mechanisms. Analyze bidding strategies, winner’s curse, and
clearing price discovery.

Implemented Auction Types-
1 English Auction: Open ascending auction where highest bidder wins.
2 Dutch Auction: Descending price auction where first acceptance wins.
3 Sealed-Bid Auction: Confidential bids, highest bid wins.

Winner’s Curse Analysis-
Simulation demonstrates that aggressive bidding in common-value auctions often leads to
overpayment. Conservative strategies reduce this risk.

Clearing Price Discovery-
Clearing prices are computed using market equilibrium principles based on bid distributions and
auction rules.

Conclusion-
This project demonstrates auction theory, strategic bidding behavior, and practical market
simulation techniques.
